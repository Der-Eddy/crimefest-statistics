YACSS - Yet Another Crimefest Statistics Site  
Displays the progression of the [PayDay2 Crimefest 2015 Challanges](http://www.overkillsoftware.com/games/roadtocrimefest/) in a cool looking site. The site will refresh itself every 15 seconds via AJAX Requests.

Requirements
-------------

Since the Steam Web API doesn't allow Cross Domain Calls, the Steam Statistics will be fetched by a PHP File. I optimized the PHP Script so it won't spam the Steam Web API Server (and ip ban you).

Screenshoots
